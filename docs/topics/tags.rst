Tags allow giving documents a toggable property. Documents can also be tagged
with more than one tag. Once tagged, documents can be search also by their tags
and from the tags main menu a list of all the documents with a particular tag
can be obtained easily. Aside from their texts, tags can be assigned a particular
color.
