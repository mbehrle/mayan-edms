Smart links
===========


Smart links are usefull for navigation between documents. They are rule
based but don't create any organizational structure, just show the documents
that match the rules as evaluated against the metadata of the currently
displayed document.

Smart links are usefull when a patient file in a patients index needs to be linked
to the medical documentation of a prescription the patient is using, but that medical
documentation is in it's own prescription index. Smart links can provide a reference
between documents of different indexes without any change in the indexes' structures.
