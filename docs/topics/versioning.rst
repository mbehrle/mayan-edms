===================
Document versioning
===================

**Mayan EDMS** has the ability to store different versions of the same
document. A comment field is provided to allow users to summarize the new
version changes in comparison with the previous one. If a new version was
uploded by mistake or such new version is no longer necessary the option to
revert to a previous version of the document is provided.

To upload a new document version, select an existing document, click on the
version tab of the document, and click on the 'upload new version' on the
side bar. A new view very similar to the new document upload view will
appear, showing the same interactive document sources that have been defined.
