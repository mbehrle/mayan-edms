History and overview
====================

**Mayan EDMS** started as a simple project whose only requirement was the storage of PDF files, from there it has grown into a complete electronic document management solution.
**Mayan EDMS** can optimize an organization's bulk upload, storage and retrieval of documents.
Documents are organized using document classes, user defined metadata fields as well as automatic document grouping and indexing.  Documents can be retrieved from the document index or by means of full
text searching.  Users can search for terms in the document's metadata, properties or contents extracted from PDFs or transcribed by OCR_.

**Mayan EDMS** is written in Python_ using the Django_ framework, which makes it very agile and fast, specially when compared with existing Java based solutions.
Being based on patent free, `Open source`_ technologies, **Mayan EDMS** provides legal safety to users and organizations, as well as peace of mind as documents and all related information is stored in open source and transparent formats allowing portability and avoiding `vendor lock-in`_.
Being written using Python_, **Mayan EDMS** runs on many POSIX compliant operating systems. Featuring many configuration parameters, **Mayan EDMS** allows to be deployed on many hardware and software configurations such as single server based, clusters, virtualized and cloud based hosting giving adopters the choice of using the infrastructure of their choice.
