Indexes
=======

Indexes are an automatic method to hierarchically organize documents in relation to their properties.

Index templates
===============

Since multiple indexes can be defined, the first step is to create an empty index.
Administrators then define the tree template showing how the index will be structured.
Each branch can be a pseudo folder, which can hold other child 'folders' or
a document container which will have all the links to the documents that
matched the criteria of the document container.

Index instances
===============

The template is the skeleton from which an instance of the index is then
auto-populated with links to the documents depending on the rules of each
branch of the index evaluated against the metadata and properties of the documents.
